<h1 align="center">Shell</h1>

This project consists of a C++ program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. This project can be compiled on any Linux, UNIX, or Mac OS X system. A shell interface gives the user a prompt, after which the next command is entered.
